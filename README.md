# Beanshell Demo
[Beanshell](http://www.beanshell.org) is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.

This is a demo project to show the power of beanshell.
